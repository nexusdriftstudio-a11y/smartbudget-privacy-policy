        <h1>Terms of Use for SmartBudget AI</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 13, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using the SmartBudget AI mobile application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and NexusDrift Studio ("we", "our", "us"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not permitted to use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>SmartBudget AI is an offline personal finance management application. All data you enter is stored locally and encrypted on your device. We do not have access to your financial data.</p>

        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the data you enter, maintaining the security of your device and credentials (Master Key), and for creating and storing backups of your data. We are not liable for any data loss.</p>

        <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU USE THE APP AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE ARE NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, AND THE APP SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL ADVICE.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEXUSDRIFT STUDIO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP.</p>

        <h2>6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Ukraine, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. However, this does not deprive you of the protection afforded to you by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law of your usual place of residence.</p>

        <h2>7. Provisions for Users in the European Union (EU)</h2>
        <p>If you are a user in the EU, you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As all your data is stored locally, you exercise these rights directly on your device. Please see our Privacy Policy for more details on your rights.</p>

        <h2>8. Provisions for Users in the United States (USA)</h2>
        <p>If you are a user in the USA, you acknowledge that this App is provided on an "as is" basis. While state laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grant rights regarding personal information, SmartBudget AI does not collect your personal information as defined by such laws. All your data remains on your device.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any significant changes. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at: <strong>nexusdriftstudio@gmail.com</strong></p>
