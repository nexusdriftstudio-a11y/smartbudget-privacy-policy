        <h1>Privacy Policy for SmartBudget AI</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 13, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to SmartBudget AI ("the App"), operated by NexusDrift Studio ("we", "our", "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner. This Privacy Policy details how we manage information within the App.</p>
        <p>This policy is designed to comply with key privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Economic Area (EEA), Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), relevant laws in the USA, and the legislation of Ukraine.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
        <p>For the purpose of this policy, you, the user, are the Data Controller, as you have full control over the data entered and stored within the App on your device. We, as the developers, are the Data Processor only in the context of the App's functionality, but we do not access, view, or collect your data.</p>

        <h2>3. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>SmartBudget AI is an offline-first application. We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any personal or financial data you enter into the App.</strong> This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, or other contact information (except as described for authentication).</li>
            <li>Transaction details, amounts, categories, or notes.</li>
            <li>Budget information, wallet balances, or debt records.</li>
            <li>Device identifiers, location data, or usage analytics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data you provide is stored exclusively in a secure, encrypted database on your local device.</p>

        <h2>4. Information Processed by Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>To provide certain features, we utilize trusted third-party services. These services operate under their own privacy policies and may collect data. We have chosen them for their commitment to security and privacy.</p>
        
        <h3>4.1. Authentication Services (Google Sign-In & Apple Sign-In)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To offer a secure and convenient way to create and access your account within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Processed:</strong> When you choose to use these services, we receive a basic user profile from Google or Apple. This typically includes your name, email address, and a profile picture URL.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> This profile information is stored <strong>only on your local device</strong> to personalize your experience (e.g., display your name and avatar). It is never sent to our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Their Policies:</strong> We encourage you to review their privacy policies:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2. Advertising Services (Google AdMob)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To display advertisements that support the free version of the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Processed:</strong> AdMob may collect and process anonymous data, such as your device's advertising ID, IP address, and information about your device, to serve relevant ads. This data is collected and managed by Google.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt-out of personalized advertising through your device's settings (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android).</li>
            <li><strong>Their Policy:</strong> For detailed information, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google's Advertising Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. How Your Data is Secured</h2>
        <p>We take data security seriously. All data stored by the App on your device is protected by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Encryption:</strong> The local SQLite database is encrypted using robust, industry-standard algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Managed Keys:</strong> The encryption key is derived from your Master Key, ensuring that only you can decrypt and access your financial data. We never have access to this key.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR & Others)</h2>
        <p>As your data is stored locally, you have direct control over it. Your rights include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The right to access:</strong> You can access all your data at any time within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>The right to rectification:</strong> You can edit or correct your data at any time within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>The right to erasure ('right to be forgotten'):</strong> You can delete your data at any time. Deleting the App from your device will also permanently remove all its data.</li>
            <li><strong>The right to data portability:</strong> You can export your data using the App's backup feature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for individuals under the age of 16 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
